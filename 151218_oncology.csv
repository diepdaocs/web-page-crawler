We have the breadth of general gastroenterologists, but we also have the sub-subspecialties.","I have devoted my career to studying how to improve recovery from liver injury. This is important for patients with all types of liver disease, because the two main causes of death from liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer, can develop when repair of liver damage is defective.  My basic research laboratory showed that certain inflammatory factors help the liver to regenerate. In addition, we discovered that processes that form the liver during fetal development become reactivated in injured adult livers and help them to regenerate. These discoveries are leading to novel ways to diagnose and treat patients with liver disease so that cirrhosis and liver cancer can be prevented. I lead a team of scientists and doctors who are extending this work to patients. We have active clinical research programs in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, sclerosing cholangitis and cirrhosis.

Our goal is to provide the highest quality cancer care in a small, quiet and peaceful setting where patients can feel comforted seeing the same faces every day. We know your name. We remember your story. We try to make the impact of cancer on your life as small as it can be. I really like knowing I made a difference – whether it be a cure or alleviating pain and fear. That’s my favorite part of any experience with one of my patients. When I first meet someone and explain what they’re going through and what they can expect down the road, I can see relief in their eyes. They know there’s a plan and it's rewarding to know I have helped that person.","I balance clinical research and laboratory research that can be translated into improvements in treatment for cancer patients, particularly those with prostate cancer. The overarching goal of this research is to reduce the side effects of radiation therapy and to improve the quality of life for cancer survivors. This includes clinical trials that optimize and, where possible, safely reduce cancer treatment. We also are studying the mechanisms of erectile dysfunction caused by radiotherapy. Finally, I am focusing attention on how to improve the cancer survivor experience and maximize quality of life after cancer.","MD, Harvard Medical School (Massachusetts), 2002","Internal Medicine, UNC Hospitals, 2002-2003","Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, 2003-2007","Internal Medicine, UNC Hospitals, 2002-2003

And to me that was so appealing – we’re going to figure out what causes cancer and new ways to treat it. That’s what really brought me into the hematology oncology world – things were being discovered that were new and exciting and hopefully would lead to new treatment options.

The most important thing you can get from Duke is real understanding of your particular case and what your options are.

To do this, I sometimes use analogies or put things in every day terms to make things simpler.

One of the things that attracted me to the field is the long-term relationship with my patients. I tell all my patients that I’m their doctor for life. I see patients for many, many years. Back in 2000, when we had a 26-inch snow here -- it was a Tuesday -- on my clinic day, everyone said no one would come to clinic. But I actually had 23 or 24 patients show up in four-wheel drives. It’s not that I’m such a fabulous doctor that they came to see me. It’s that they are cancer patients and this was their annual visit or their followup. It was important to them. So we were here for them, and they came. I enjoy seeing my patients back 12, 13, 14 years later and learning what they’ve been up to and what their families have been up to. That’s a bond you get in oncology that a lot of other fields don’t have that treat patients then turn them back over to their primary care physicians. We as a team follow people, and I like that.","With a long history as a national leader in lung cancer clinical trials, I currently am the co-chair of the Thoracic Malignancy Steering Committee for the National Cancer Institute.

I am  a member of the Combined International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry Lymphoma Writing Committee and the ALLIANCE (formerly CALGB) Leukemia Core Committee and NCI Leukemia Working Groups. I serve as chair or co-chair of multiple ALLIANCE lymphoma/ leukemia trials, the most recent being the last two national studies for Burkitt’s lymphoma, as well as the current leukemia in under 60-year-olds study. I have led our team’s novel approaches for the care of patients using monoclonal antibodies with non-myeloablative allogeneic therapy to optimize a less toxic regimen for transplant of patients with hematologic malignancies using haplo-identical, as well as matched, donors. This work is currently being extended with post-transplant graft manipulation studies focused on manipulating Natural Killer cell activity.

My favorite part of my job is seeing children who came in with a very serious health issue – and after getting them through the surgery and recovery – when they come back to clinic and we see that they have returned to their normal lives, that they’re doing better, that they’re enjoying all the things kids should be enjoying and really getting on with their lives. It’s really rewarding to think I played a role in that child going on to have a healthy and productive life.","My research interests focus on 1) Chiari malformation and syringomyelia: part of a nationwide consortium studying Chiari malformation and syringomyelia, and best ways to treat these conditions. 2) Brain tumors: Part of the Children’s Oncology Group and the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, providing innovative treatments to children with brain tumors. 3) Use of checklists in the OR: toward safer surgery: adapting principles from aviation to the surgical environment to provide better and safer care to our patients.","MD, PhD, Duke University School of Medicine, 1984","Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, 1985-1991","Pediatric Neurosurgery, Children's Memorial Hospital (Illinois), 1991-1992","Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, 1985-1991

Duke is a unique place to come for breast imaging and breast care, because the breast team works as a unit. Everyone is in incredibly close communication. When complicated cases come in, we’re constantly in contact by phone or email so that everybody on the team understands what the complication is, and we’re all in on the discussion on how to get the best possible outcome for each patient. Clearly the best part of my job is the ability to interact with my patients. It’s unusual for radiologists to have as much interaction with patients as we do here at Duke. I get to talk with patients and give them their results before they leave. Hopefully it is good news. But if it is more concerning information, I can explain to them what everything means, what the next step is, and we can take them through the process step by step and work through it together.","My research focuses on the very practical aspects of breast imaging, and deciding which test will be most helpful in each situation. For example, I am studying how to use newly approved digital breast tomosynthesis (3-D mammograms) to better diagnose breast cancer.  I am also researching the specific appearance of calcifications on mammograms to minimize unnecessary biopsies while not delaying the diagnosis of breast cancer.  Other research involves randomized controlled trials on how to make needle biopsy procedures even more comfortable for patients.","MD, Duke University School of Medicine, 1992","Diagnostic Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, 1992-1997","Breast Imaging, Duke University Medical Center, 1997-1998","Diagnostic Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, 1992-1997

We encourage our patients to come with family members and friends and loved ones and particularly to identify one or two main go-to people in terms of care-giving and support.

I take care of patients with leukodystrophies, leukemias and other blood disorders that are resistant to standard treatment, and children with brain injuries like cerebral palsy. It’s rewarding to make a difference when treating challenging diseases. I’ve been fortunate over my career to be able to develop new treatments in the laboratory that I take into the clinic to help patients. In fact, here at Duke I was involved in the first cord-blood transplant anywhere in the world. When meeting with patients, I focus on making their experience more than just the medicine. We have a family support program for things beyond medical needs, which is especially helpful for families that are far from home. Outside of work, I like to knit, bike and spend time with my family.","My research is focused on discovering new treatments for children with blood disorders, genetic diseases and brain injuries. I have worked in the development of new drugs for patients with T-cell leukemias, used cord blood transplants for children with cancer, sickle cell anemia and leukodystrophies. I’ve learned that after a cord blood transplant, donor cells help heal the brain. My current research is focused on finding ways to use cord blood cells to help children with Krabbe disease, MLD, ALD, Hurler syndrome and other leukodystrophies.

I decided to become a doctor after spending time working with my family practitioner and getting to know patients from visit to visit. As a clinician, I still enjoy seeing that patients who have had a life-threatening disease are now living normal, healthy lives. My practice is focused around patients with brain cancer, either newly diagnosed or recurrent primary or metastatic brain tumors. We are involved with several clinical trials, so treatment can include enrollment in trials of new therapeutic agents (especially oncolytic poliovirus therapy, immunotherapy, vaccines and convection-enhanced delivery). We also evaluate patients with posterior fossa tumors (eg, acoustic neuromas or meningiomas); microvascular decompression surgery for trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm, pituitary tumors, complex skull-base tumors; radiosurgery; among other neurosurgery pathologies. In my spare time, I enjoy travel and spending time with my family.","My research focuses on a couple therapies: one is injected directly into the brain, so the rest of the body isn’t exposed to the therapy’s toxins; the other uses the body’s own immune system to attack the tumor, similar to vaccines. Both target only the cancerous cells while leaving the normal cells alone. I am constantly in pursuit of therapies that extend the life of my patients and offer clinical solutions to brain cancer.","MD, University of Manitoba Faculty of Medicine (Canada), 1990","PhD, Neuro-Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, 1994-1996","MHSc, Duke University, 2007","PhD, Neuro-Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, 1994-1996

The more experience I had with medicine, the more I liked it. I enjoy surgery, because I like the process of identifying problems and then fixing them.

In these roles, I am responsible for maintaining the standards of the College of American Pathologists and CLIA/CMS within all clinical laboratories at Duke.  Specifically, I oversees clinical testing and reporting, develop quality management systems and proficiency testing programs, provide consultation with ordering physicians and patients, develop strategic plans that are in line with the needs of our patients, physicians, and health system leadership. I also coordinate research and development for clinical laboratories, and provide profession interpretation for molecular diagnostic testing including the wide range of PCR, quantitative PCR, sequencing and FISH based tests for inherited genetic diseases, hematologic malignancies, solid tumors and infectious diseases.","My research program focuses on developing multi-gene assays to determine cancer patient-specific prognoses in the context of breast, ovary and colon cancer. The ultimate goal of this work is to produce improved molecular diagnostic assays that incorporate genome-wide prognostic and diagnostic molecular profiling into the clinical laboratories for routine patient care. This involves the study of factors that affect the precision and accuracy of array-based and next generation sequencing-based approaches, as well as the discovery of new diagnostic molecular makers.","MD, Duke University School of Medicine, 1999","PhD, Molecular Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, 1999","Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, 2004","PhD, Molecular Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, 1999

I’ve been at Duke Raleigh for eight years and also serve as the hospital’s chief medical officer. My favorite part of my job is the initial patient visit. It’s not unusual for patients to arrive for their appointment feeling fearful and anxious.  I enjoy making them feel more comfortable and at ease with their diagnosis and treatment plan by the end of the visit. To further build that bond and trust, I encourage my patients to have full access to me, even on weekends or holidays, so I can help guide their treatment. I decided to become a doctor when I was 18 years old and heading to college. I felt that I would be passionate about taking care of people, and my intuition turned out to be right. I am married to a physician and my oldest son is a medical school graduate, so medicine is now firmly in my family’s blood.","My research revolves around clinical trials. These studies, which are made possible by the selfless participation of patients, help us identify optimal treatments for harmful diseases. Without these studies, we would have been unable to achieve many of our amazing advancements in medicine.

By protecting the heart, it allows us to treat our patients’ cancers as aggressively as possible. I also like to educate patients. This is based on my own experience with physicians. Instructions didn’t resonate with me without an explanation. Understanding gave me more buy-in. Now, when I see patients, I try to spend as much time as possible explaining the issues and find that at times even illustrating with pictures can help make things clearer. I think it helps patients to understand what is going on and feel more invested in their care.",My primary interest is in the emerging field of cardio-oncology (the intersection of heart disease and cancer) where I hope to improve how we identify cancer patients at higher risk for developing heart disease and heart failure during cancer therapy and afterwards.  My clinic primarily focuses on seeing patients with heart disease and cancer. I have also published in medical journals and presented at national meetings on new heart imaging technologies and exercise testing that may help us identify early heart disease in cancer patients.,"MD, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (New York), 2004","Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 2004-2007 (Chief Resident, 2007-2008)","Cardiovascular Diseases and Cardiovascular Imaging, Duke University Medical Center, 2008-2012","Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 2004-2007 (Chief Resident, 2007-2008)

We take care of the disease -- which is important, because these are very serious, potentially fatal diseases. But at the same time, we pay attention to patients’ emotional and psychological well-being in addition to their physical well-being. And not only for patients but also the whole family, because the caregivers and other parts of the family need attention as well. I wanted to go into medicine, because it was a great way to interact and take care of patients. n my mind, cancer is one of two diseases within internal medicine where you can actually cure people. The best part of bone marrow transplant is that the time between the laboratory and the patient is short. Patients who need a transplant tend to be relatively sick and in need of new therapies. That’s been very intellectually challenging and fun.","My research interests are treatments for blood diseases, graft-versus-host disease, leukemia and lymphoma.","MD, Yale University School of Medicine (Connecticut), 1981","Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center (California), 1981-1984","Oncology, Stanford University Medical Center (California), 1985-1987","Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center (California), 1981-1984

I strive to take the very best care of my patients that I possibly can. Working with world-class colleagues and a multidisciplinary team which includes radiation and surgical oncologists makes this possible. I first became interested in oncology as a first-year medical student when I got to see tumors in my pathology class. I came to appreciate the beauty of the gastrointestinal tract while observing GI surgeries as a second-year medical student. My fascination with how cancers develop and how we may develop new therapies to treat cancer led me to pursue a PhD in molecular cancer biology. This training honed the critical thinking skills that I still use to this day, as I think critically about how best to treat my patients. The close relationships that oncologists have with patients and their families clinched my decision to pursue a career as a medical oncologist. During my fellowship training, I sought out subspecialty training in GI oncology.  When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband and three young children, and running.","My long-term goal is to develop new therapies to treat patients with gastrointestinal and other solid tumors. To accomplish this, I am active in designing, writing, and running phase I and II clinical trials. I am also interested in the correlative science that furthers our understanding of cancer at a molecular level. I am interested in the identification of biomarkers, which are characteristics of a given patient's tumor that may help us to understand his or her prognosis or how well he or she may respond to a given therapy. The overall objective of this research is to use the knowledge gained to personalize care and find the very best therapies that will enable our patients to fight their cancer.","MD, Duke University School of Medicine, 2008","PhD, Molecular Cancer Biology, Duke University, 2007","Internal Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, 2008-2011","PhD, Molecular Cancer Biology, Duke University, 2007

A patient should want to come here, because we offer what few places in the country can offer -- the breadth of what we can deal with and how we can deal with it. The expertise we have is unsurpassed in this region, if not in the country. I was lucky enough to start with the minimally invasive surgery movement about 15 years ago. We have moved from the very simple operations to the most complex. At this point there is almost no operation that can’t be done using minimally invasive techniques. Even with complicated, significant surgeries, we can show how much we can change people’s lives and do it better than in the standard open surgery approach. At the same time, very simple operations can become even simpler when done using minimally invasive techniques.","The focus of my research is defining the efficacy of surgical techniques, with a particular lean toward understanding ways to minimize post-surgical problems. From a clinical research standpoint, this has included prospective and retrospective analysis of my own patients as well as the use of nationwide databases. As a director of the degenerative section of the Association for Collaborative Spine Research, one of the largest such study groups in the world, I help guide national clinical data collection efforts among member academic institutions in order to advance the care of patients with degenerative diseases of the spine.","MD, Baylor College of Medicine (Texas), 1995","Neurosurgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Tennessee), 1996-2001","Endoscopic and Complex Spine Surgery, Rush University, Chicago Institute of Neurosurgery and Neuroresearch, 2001-2002","Neurosurgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Tennessee), 1996-2001

This includes a shared-decision-making process, team based care and continuous clinical outcomes collection. Educating and giving my patients access to information is a central piece of my approach. My philosophy is that the better educated patients are on their conditions, the better healthcare choices they are able to make. In the event that a patient needs surgery, we focus on optimizing and preparing prior to surgery with the purpose of improving outcomes. Complex spinal problems are better treated in an interdisciplinary, or team based, care environment. These collaborations are built into the Duke Spine Center and allow us to provide the best care and outcomes to patients with spine problems.","I am interested in studying methods to improve the safety of complex spinal procedures, including the monitoring of the spinal cord function, and also the process of clotting of blood during the procedure. I am also studying the effects of a pre-habilitation protocol (rehab prior to surgery) on clinical outcomes and peri-operative morbidity. I think that improving cardiovascular stance and endurance prior to surgery has a profound effect on the results of surgery - the stronger you are, the faster and better you recover. I am also studying the effect of spinal deformity in adults (scoliosis, kyphosis) on balance and equilibrium. The ability of a patient to stand and walk is mostly affected by the deformation of the main axis of the body, resulting in increased effort to stand and walk and increased risk of falls.","MD, Universidad Católica (Chile)","Orthopaedic Surgery, Universidad Católica (Chile)","Spinal Deformity Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 2003","Orthopaedic Surgery, Universidad Católica (Chile)

I give out my pager and cell phone numbers, and patients can call me at any time, or text, or use email or pager. That allows me to follow patients very carefully and try to avoid problems before they crop up. In addition to providing cutting-edge therapies, we provide a lot of compassion. At Duke, there really is hope.","My research interests are in developing new strategies for treatment of children with brain tumors.  My special focus is in the development of phase I and II trials of new drugs for children with brain tumors, including novel chemotherapy agents, small molecule inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases, anti-angiogenesis inhibitors, pharmacologic strategies that lead to reversal of drug resistance to alkylating agents, immunotherapy approaches to the treatment of recurrent medulloblastoma, and radioimmunotherapy for neoplastic meningitis.","MBBS, Stanley Medical College (India), 1982",Fellow.

I’ve been in practice for 24 years, and at Duke for 17. I always wanted to become a surgeon. I grew up as a classical pianist and wanted to get into a field where I used my hands and could help make a big difference in people’s lives. I had excellent mentors who specialized in urology, so I followed in their footsteps when it came time to choose a specialty. When I see a new patient, I first try to determine how fast their tumor is growing. When treating those who have fast growing tumors, I try to use the least invasive method possible.  I enjoy being able to treat patients and get them back to a point where they can resume a high quality of life.","I study minimally invasive surgical outcomes (robotics, laparoscopy) for prostate and kidney cancers. I perform and research needle-based outpatient treatments called “focal therapy,” which removes the cancer while preserving the remainder of the prostate and a man’s sexual/urinary function. I also study imaging techniques for prostate cancer (e.g. MRI) and prostate cryosurgery for primary and recurrent prostate cancer. In 2008, I founded the first international meeting on focal therapy in prostate and kidney cancer. I conduct research into minimally invasive robotic and laparoscopic surgery for prostate cancer.  We aim to optimize functional outcomes, such as preservation of erections and urinary control for men while curing prostate cancer. Patients can benefit by having minimally invasive robotic surgery or cryotherapy, thereby optimizing their cancer outcomes, potentially preserving their bodily functions and minimizing their stay in the hospital setting.

My research team has an interest in kidney cancer ranging from minimally invasive treatments to handling complex kidney tumors, often involving several tumors in one or both kidneys.  We conduct research on outcomes, development of new treatments and imaging methods to characterize kidney tumors.  Patients benefit by having access to minimally invasive treatments such as needle ablation approaches, cryotherapy, robotics and laparoscopy.","MD, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine (Illinois), 1991","General Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Maryland), 1991-1993","Urology, James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Maryland), 1993-1997","General Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Maryland), 1991-1993

As a head and neck surgeon, I carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment — working with our team to maximize the chance for cure while maintaining the highest quality of life. As a physician, my approach to patient care includes addressing one's physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual needs and well-being. My research endeavors strive to improve the care we provide to patients with head and neck cancers. I have a research focus on tumor immunotherapy. I am active in addressing global health needs, being involved with regular humanitarian mission trips throughout the world. I am also active in training the next generation of surgeons that are able to address and solve challenges in an ethical and virtuous way. I have, along with my colleagues, developed and instituted a virtue-based approach to residency training that will meet this need. When not at work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and three boys in a variety of activities.",My research is concentrated on improving the care of cancer patients through three areas. First is in how the body's own immune system can defend and fight cancer. Second is through biomedical engineering technologies that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Third is building teams through virtuous leadership training to deliver excellent care to the patient and their families.,"MD, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences (Washington, DC), 1999","Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Cleveland Clinic (Ohio), 1999-2005","Oncology (Research), Cleveland Clinic (Ohio), 2006","Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Cleveland Clinic (Ohio), 1999-2005

Durham, NC 27710","Durham, NC 27710",27710,Orthopaedic Cancer Surgeon,"As an orthopedic oncologist, I treat cancers of the bone and muscle. My background is very different from most doctors. I started as a veterinarian and became interested in cancer because so many dogs have cancer, and I came to medical school to learn how to treat and beat some of these types of cancer. I’m still a veterinarian, and that’s a big part of what we do here. Many cancers of the bone and muscles, called sarcomas, are rare in people, but common in dogs. So continuing to treat dogs with this type of cancer lets us and our group gain a deeper understanding of how these cancers work. With my patients, I try to find out what the cancer has taken from them, and what their goals are for how to get back in control. For some, their goal is to beat the cancer no matter what. For others, the goal is to keep walking or to be able to walk again, or to be in less pain. Then we try to tailor our approach to the patient. Often, people think being a surgical oncologist must be a terrible job. But I find something in each patient to admire, because patients dealing with cancer develop a strength the rest of us don’t get to have.","My laboratory focuses on comparative oncology -- the study of cancers from one species to another.  Because sarcomas are rare in people but common in dogs, we attempt to learn as much as we can from every patient with a sarcoma, regardless of whether that patient walks on two legs or four.","MD, University of Vermont College of Medicine, 2006","Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, 2006-2011","Musculoskeletal Oncology, University of Toronto, 2011-2012","Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, 2006-2011
